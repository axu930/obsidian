# State-of-the-Art Text Embedding and Retrieval Models for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Executive Summary

This report provides an in-depth analysis of the current state-of-the-art in text embedding and retrieval models, with a particular focus on their application within Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. The examination covers leading proprietary and open-source models, detailing their architectural foundations, typical sizes, and performance characteristics. The critical role of these models in enhancing the accuracy, relevance, and contextual understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) by grounding their responses in external knowledge is highlighted. Key evaluation benchmarks are discussed, alongside emerging trends such as real-time, multimodal, and personalized RAG, offering insights into the future trajectory of this rapidly evolving field.

## 1. Introduction to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

### 1.1 The Foundational Role of Text Embeddings and Retrieval in RAG

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) represents an advanced artificial intelligence methodology designed to significantly enhance the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external, dynamic information sources. This approach is instrumental in mitigating inherent limitations of LLMs, such as factual inaccuracies or "hallucinations" that can arise from reliance on static training data.1

At the core of RAG systems are text embeddings, which are numerical vector representations derived from textual data. These embeddings are meticulously crafted to capture the semantic meaning and contextual nuances of text, enabling LLMs to comprehend the underlying meaning rather than merely matching keywords.4 The quality of these embeddings directly dictates the efficiency and accuracy of retrieval within RAG pipelines. By comparing the embeddings of user queries with those of a vast corpus of documents, RAG systems can swiftly identify and retrieve the most contextually relevant information.4

A fundamental shift in information retrieval is observed with the widespread adoption of embedding-based approaches. Traditional methods, such as keyword matching, operate at a lexical level, focusing on the presence of exact words or phrases. For instance, BM25, a widely used traditional method, is noted for its "lack of semantic understanding" and inability to account for synonyms, paraphrases, or deeper semantic relationships.6 In contrast, modern embedding models are designed to capture the "semantic meaning and context" of text.4 This distinction is not merely an incremental improvement but a fundamental change in how information is accessed and understood. By moving beyond brittle keyword matches to conceptual understanding, embedding-based retrieval ensures that the context provided to LLMs is truly relevant and nuanced, even when the precise query terms are absent from the documents. This directly contributes to the LLM's capacity to generate more accurate, contextually appropriate, and sophisticated responses, thereby elevating the overall quality of AI-generated content.

### 1.2 Advantages of RAG in Enhancing LLM Performance

RAG significantly enhances the quality and relevance of generated text by dynamically incorporating contextually relevant information from external knowledge bases.4 A primary benefit of RAG is its ability to mitigate "hallucinations" in LLMs, grounding responses in verifiable facts and allowing users to check citations, thereby increasing trust and reliability in the generated output.1

Furthermore, RAG offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for integrating up-to-date information into LLM responses without the need for frequent and expensive retraining of the entire language model.2 This is particularly advantageous as knowledge bases evolve rapidly.

Despite the rapid increase in LLM context window sizes, which now commonly extend to 128,000 tokens and beyond, RAG remains highly effective. Some might initially perceive larger context windows as potentially rendering RAG obsolete, assuming that simply pasting all necessary information into the LLM's context window would suffice.2 However, this perspective overlooks the crucial function RAG performs as an intelligent, pre-processing, and curatorial layer. While a large context window allows an LLM to _receive_ a greater volume of input, it does not inherently solve the challenge of _identifying and prioritizing_ the most relevant information from a vast, potentially noisy, external corpus. The LLM might still struggle with information overload or the "needle in a haystack" problem within an extremely long context. Benchmarks consistently demonstrate that RAG can significantly improve accuracy (e.g., Llama 4 achieved an accuracy of 78% when using RAG, compared to 66% when relying solely on its long context window).1 This performance gap is particularly evident when the system needs to search millions of documents or evaluate contradictory information to generate a more accurate response.1 Therefore, RAG is not made obsolete by larger context windows; rather, it becomes a crucial component for efficient and precise knowledge grounding at scale, transforming the LLM from a general reasoner into a domain-aware expert capable of delivering highly accurate and contextually rich information.

## 2. State-of-the-Art Text Embedding Models

### 2.1 Overview of Leading Embedding Models (Proprietary and Open-Source)

Text embedding models are fundamental for converting text into vector representations that capture semantic meaning, which is essential for tasks like semantic search and reranking in RAG systems.5 The landscape of state-of-the-art embedding models includes both proprietary and open-source solutions, each with distinct strengths and characteristics.

**Proprietary Models:**

- **Gemini Embedding:** Google's experimental model has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving the top rank on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) Multilingual leaderboard with a mean score of 68.32, a significant margin (+5.81) over its closest competitor.4 This model is trained on the Gemini model itself, inheriting its advanced understanding of language and nuanced context, making it applicable for a wide range of uses across diverse domains such as finance, science, legal, and search. It is designed to work effectively out-of-the-box, minimizing the need for extensive fine-tuning for specific tasks.4
- **OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large/small:** These models are recognized as leading dense models, providing high-quality semantic search capabilities and are frequently utilized in RAG benchmarks.1
- **Cohere's embedding models:** These are also prominent proprietary solutions offering robust text embedding capabilities.5

**Open-Source Models:**

- **E5 Family (e.g., intfloat/e5-large-v2, intfloat/multilingual-e5-large-instruct):** These models are widely recognized as high-quality dense models for semantic search.5 The `intfloat/e5-large-v2` model features 24 layers and an embedding size of 1024, specifically designed for efficient embedding generation and trained using weakly-supervised contrastive pre-training.8 The `intfloat/multilingual-e5-large-instruct` is a robust multilingual model with 560 million parameters and 1024 dimensions, built on the `xlm-roberta-large` architecture. It supports over 100 languages and achieves quality comparable to leading English-only models through a two-stage training process.9
- **Salesforce/SFR-Embedding-2_R:** This is a substantial model with 7.11 billion parameters, specifically developed for research applications. It has demonstrated strong performance on MTEB benchmarks, excelling in retrieval, classification, and semantic textual similarity tasks. It supports a maximum sequence length of 4096 tokens.7
- **Alibaba-NLP/gte-Qwen2-7B-instruct:** A high-performance model with 7 billion parameters, this is part of the gte (General Text Embedding) model family.7
- **BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5:** A BAAI General Embedding model for English, featuring 109 million parameters. It maps text to a 768-dimensional vector and supports up to 512 tokens, based on a BERT-based architecture.7
- **Jina Embeddings v2 (e.g., jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-base-en, jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-base-code):** These models are relatively compact at 0.1 billion parameters, optimized for English text and code embeddings, respectively.7 Jina ColBERT v2, for example, produces 128-dimensional vectors.4
- **NV-Embed-v2:** Developed by NVIDIA, this generalist embedding model fine-tunes a base LLM (Mistral 7B) to provide text embeddings.12
- **Nomic-Embed-Text-v1.5:** A multimodal generalist embedding model from Nomic.12
- **stella_en_1.5B_v5:** This model, with 1.5 billion parameters, is notably smaller (approximately 5x smaller) than other top models (which are often ~7B parameters) while still achieving competitive performance.12

The range of model sizes, from compact designs to models with billions of parameters, indicates that the "state-of-the-art" is not solely defined by the largest models. The consistent emergence of smaller models that achieve competitive performance, such as `stella_en_1.5B_v5` at 1.5 billion parameters, `BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5` at 109 million parameters, and Jina Embeddings v2 at 0.1 billion parameters, suggests a significant focus on the efficiency frontier of embedding models.7 This trend is a direct result of advancements in training methodologies, including sophisticated contrastive learning techniques and multi-stage training approaches, which enable these smaller models to learn high-quality embeddings with fewer parameters. The practical implication of this development is profound: smaller models directly translate to lower computational costs for inference and memory, as well as reduced latency.7 This broadens the accessibility of advanced embedding capabilities, making high-quality RAG systems more feasible for a wider range of applications and resource constraints, thereby democratizing sophisticated natural language processing solutions.

### 2.2 Architectures of Text Embedding Models

The architectural landscape of text embedding models is diverse, reflecting various strategies to convert text into meaningful numerical representations.

#### 2.2.1 Encoder-Only Architectures (e.g., BERT-based, E5, BGE)

Encoder-only transformers, initially popularized by models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), have become the prevalent architecture for generating text embeddings.18 Models such as the E5 family (e.g., E5 Base, E5-large-v2) and BGE (e.g., BGE-base-en-v1.5) are built upon these foundational transformer architectures. These models are typically trained using weakly-supervised contrastive pre-training, a technique that enables them to learn robust semantic representations from vast text datasets by differentiating between similar and dissimilar text pairs.8 Their primary function is to map input text, whether sentences or paragraphs, into a dense, fixed-size vector space where semantically similar texts are positioned in close proximity.

#### 2.2.2 Decoder-Only Architectures (e.g., Gemma-2B)

While encoder-only models have historically dominated, recent advancements in decoder-only transformers, often associated with large generative models like GPT, have led to their successful adaptation for embedding tasks.18 For instance, the Gemma-2B embedding model is initialized as a symmetric dual encoder, leveraging the pre-trained knowledge inherent in the decoder-only Gemma-2B model. This model incorporates a linear projection layer applied after pooling the outputs along the sequence length dimension to derive embeddings, which are then trained with a contrastive loss.18 This represents an interesting trend of repurposing powerful generative models for efficient embedding generation, capitalizing on their extensive language understanding capabilities.

#### 2.2.3 Dual Encoder Architectures (e.g., DPR, Symmetric Dual Encoders)

Dual encoder architectures are a cornerstone of dense retrieval systems. Models like Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) are composed of two distinct encoder components: one dedicated to processing the query and another for the document or passage.22 Both encoders are typically implemented using transformer-based models, such as BERT, and are trained to project queries and documents into a shared, continuous embedding space.22 The training process frequently employs a contrastive learning approach, which aims to maximize the similarity between a query and its relevant (positive) passages while simultaneously minimizing similarity with irrelevant (negative) passages.22 This architectural design allows for efficient pre-computation of document embeddings, making them highly scalable for large text corpora.

#### 2.2.4 Multi-Vector Embeddings (e.g., ColBERT)

ColBERT (Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT) signifies a notable advancement in dense retrieval by moving beyond single-vector representations for entire texts. It is a multi-vector embedding model that fine-tunes a BERT backbone.23 Instead of producing a single embedding for an entire text, ColBERT generates multiple fixed-size vectors (e.g., 128 dimensions) for each token in the input document.4 This approach facilitates a more fine-grained, late-interaction matching mechanism between query and document representations. The similarity score is computed by summing the maximum similarity between query tokens and document token embeddings.24 This allows for a more comprehensive engagement with tokens across the entire document collection, potentially improving relevance and reducing search costs by enabling a coarse single-vector search followed by a fine-grained multi-vector search.24

#### 2.2.5 Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) for Flexible Dimensions

Google's Gemini Embedding model introduces Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) as a key feature.4 This innovative technique allows for the truncation of the model's original high-dimensional output (3K dimensions) to a smaller desired size without significant loss of quality.4 The presence of 3K output dimensions is considered high-dimensional, which typically implies higher storage costs and increased computational overhead for vector similarity search. MRL directly addresses this by enabling developers to "truncate the original 3K dimensions to scale down to meet your desired storage cost".4 This capability is critical for practical deployment, as it provides a configurable parameter for developers to dynamically adjust the trade-off between embedding quality (which often correlates with higher dimensions) and resource efficiency (storage, retrieval speed). A single powerful model can thus serve diverse deployment environments, from resource-constrained edge devices to high-performance cloud infrastructures, without requiring separate models or re-embedding processes. This flexibility signifies a move towards more adaptive and resource-aware embedding solutions, making advanced RAG capabilities more versatile and economically viable across a broader spectrum of real-world applications.

### 2.3 Typical Model Sizes and Performance Considerations for Embeddings

Text embedding models exhibit a wide range of sizes and performance characteristics, which are crucial considerations for deployment in RAG systems.

Parameter Counts:

Embedding models vary significantly in size, from highly compact models to very large ones:

- **Small:** Jina Embeddings v2 (~0.1 billion parameters).7
- **Medium:** BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5 (109 million parameters) 15, intfloat/multilingual-e5-large-instruct (560 million parameters).10
- **Large:** Google Gecko (1 billion parameters) 18, ColPali (~3 billion parameters) 23, Alibaba-NLP/gte-Qwen2-7B-instruct (7 billion parameters) 7, Salesforce/SFR-Embedding-2_R (7.11 billion parameters).11 Foundational models like BERT-base, often used as backbones, have 110 million parameters, while BERT-large has 340 million parameters.19

Output Dimensions (Embedding Size):

The dimensionality of the output vectors also varies, impacting storage and computational requirements:

- Common embedding dimensions include 128 (ColBERT 23), 768 (E5 Base 20, BGE-base-en-v1.5 14, Google Gecko 18), 1024 (E5-large-v2 8, multilingual-e5-large-instruct 9), 2048 (Gemma-2B embedding model) 18, and up to 3K (Gemini Embedding).4

Max Sequence Length:

The maximum input sequence length a model can process into a single embedding is another important factor:

- Many models support a maximum input sequence length of 512 tokens, which is often sufficient for paragraph-level text.7
- Some models, like Jina ColBERT v2 (8192 tokens) and SFR-Embedding-2_R (4096 tokens), support significantly longer inputs, allowing for embedding larger chunks of text or code.9

Performance Considerations:

A crucial trade-off exists between model size and operational efficiency: larger models typically demand more computational resources, leading to higher running costs and increased inference latency.7 A practical guideline suggests initiating development with a smaller model (around 500 million parameters) and scaling up only if performance requirements demonstrably necessitate it.7

Furthermore, fine-tuning pre-trained embedding models on domain-specific datasets can substantially improve their performance for particular use cases. This specialized training often allows these models to outperform larger general-purpose models in niche applications. Examples include CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT, which are designed for programming language understanding, and the Math Similarity Model, tailored for mathematical tasks.3 This highlights that the "state-of-the-art" in text embeddings is not a singular, universally applicable model, but rather a dynamic landscape where the optimal choice is highly dependent on the specific deployment context. Factors such as budget constraints, latency requirements, and the nature of the data (general vs. specialized domain) heavily influence model selection. For practitioners, this implies that a rigorous evaluation process is essential. Blindly adopting the highest-ranked model on a general benchmark like MTEB might lead to suboptimal results or excessive operational costs in a real-world RAG system. The true "best" model is the one that achieves the required performance while adhering to the practical constraints of the application.

## 3. State-of-the-Art Text Retrieval Models

### 3.1 Overview of Retrieval Paradigms

Text retrieval models are crucial components of RAG systems, responsible for identifying and fetching relevant documents from a vast corpus. Various paradigms exist, each with distinct mechanisms and performance characteristics.

#### 3.1.1 Sparse Retrieval (e.g., BM25)

Sparse retrieval methods, such as BM25 (Best Matching 25), remain foundational in information retrieval. BM25 is a probabilistic ranking function that estimates document relevance based on the frequency of query terms within a document, their inverse document frequency across the corpus, and document length normalization.6 It is highly regarded for its simplicity, effectiveness, and scalability, making it computationally efficient for large corpora.6 However, its primary limitation lies in its lack of semantic understanding; it operates strictly at the lexical level, struggling to account for synonyms, paraphrases, or deeper conceptual relationships. It also does not incorporate external knowledge beyond term statistics.6 Despite these limitations, BM25 is frequently employed for fast initial retrieval, particularly within hybrid retrieval systems.5

#### 3.1.2 Dense Retrieval (e.g., DPR, ColBERT)

Dense retrieval models represent a significant advancement by encoding queries and documents into dense numerical vectors (embeddings) within a shared continuous embedding space.22

- **Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR):** A prominent example, DPR employs neural networks, typically transformer-based models like BERT, as separate encoders for queries and passages.22 These encoders are trained using a contrastive learning approach to ensure that semantically similar texts are mapped closely in the vector space.22 DPR excels at capturing semantic meaning and context, leading to higher-quality results that align better with user intent compared to keyword-based methods.22 A challenge for dense retrieval models can be their performance with highly specialized jargon or rare terms not adequately represented in their training data.28
- **ColBERT:** This multi-vector dense retrieval model refines the dense approach by generating multiple embeddings per document token. This allows for a more fine-grained, late-interaction matching mechanism between query and document representations.1 This enables a deeper, more comprehensive engagement with document content, improving the precision of retrieval.24

#### 3.1.3 Generative Retrieval (e.g., DOGR)

Generative retrieval constitutes an innovative paradigm that leverages generative language models (LMs) to directly produce a ranked list of document identifiers for a given query.29 This approach fundamentally simplifies the retrieval pipeline by internalizing the external index within the model's parameters.29

**DOGR (Leveraging Document-Oriented Contrastive Learning in Generative Retrieval):** This novel framework employs a two-stage learning strategy. The first stage focuses on identifier generation, learning the relationships between queries and keyword-based document identifiers. The second stage fine-tunes the model with contrastive learning to directly capture the semantic relationship between the query and the complete document. This is further enhanced by sophisticated negative sampling methods, including prefix-oriented and retrieval-augmented techniques.29 The approach of generative retrieval, as exemplified by DOGR, where the model "replaces the large external index with model parameters" and "generates relevant document identifiers end-to-end," represents a significant architectural departure from traditional retrieval.29 Instead of searching a pre-built index, the model itself generates the identifiers of relevant documents. This could potentially streamline the RAG pipeline by tightly integrating retrieval with the generative process, reducing the overhead associated with managing separate indexing infrastructure. However, this paradigm also introduces new considerations regarding the handling of dynamic knowledge bases that are constantly updated. Without an external index, maintaining up-to-date information might necessitate continuous fine-tuning or specialized update mechanisms for the model parameters, which could be computationally intensive. This suggests a trade-off between pipeline simplicity and the agility of knowledge base updates.

#### 3.1.4 Hybrid Retrieval Approaches

Recognizing the complementary strengths of sparse and dense methods, hybrid retrieval approaches are increasingly favored. These methods combine keyword-based search (like BM25) with sophisticated semantic search techniques (using dense embeddings or knowledge graphs).5 This combination often yields superior results, especially for complex datasets, by leveraging the precision of lexical matching alongside the contextual understanding of semantic embeddings.5 Frameworks like Haystack offer `HybridPipeline` components to facilitate the integration of various retrievers and readers for optimal performance.31

The observation that sparse retrieval (BM25) is efficient but lacks semantic understanding, while dense retrieval offers semantic understanding but can struggle with rare terms or out-of-domain data, leads to a clear conclusion: no single retrieval paradigm is universally optimal.5 Each method possesses inherent strengths and weaknesses. Consequently, hybrid approaches emerge as a pragmatic engineering solution to achieve robustness across diverse query types and data characteristics, aiming to harness the advantages of both lexical and semantic matching. This highlights the importance of designing flexible and modular RAG system architectures that can seamlessly integrate different retrieval components. Future innovations in retrieval may therefore focus less on perfecting a singular method and more on developing sophisticated fusion techniques and adaptive strategies for combining multiple retrieval signals to maximize overall performance.

### 3.2 Reranking Models and Their Architectures

Reranking models play a crucial role in refining the initial set of retrieved documents, reordering them to highlight the most relevant ones and significantly boosting the precision of RAG outputs.5

- **Cross-Encoders:** Cross-encoders are a dominant architecture for reranking. Models like `monoBERT` (Nogueira et al., 2019) are built on top of pre-trained transformer models, such as BERT.5 Unlike dual encoders, which process queries and documents independently, cross-encoders take both the query and a candidate document (or passage) as a concatenated input, processing them together through a single transformer model to compute a direct relevance score.32 This deep, joint interaction allows for a more nuanced understanding of the query-document relationship, leading to higher reranking precision. `monoBERT` typically has 110 million parameters, likely based on a BERT-base architecture.24 Other examples include `MonoT5` (3 billion parameters), `SimLM-Rank`, `RankLLaMA`, `RankVicuna`, and `RankGPT`, which leverage larger generative LLMs for reranking, indicating a trend towards using increasingly powerful models for this task.24
- **Sequence Compressive Vectors (SCV):** SCV is a multi-vector retrieval model designed for both coarse single-vector search and fine-grained multi-vector search during inference, aiming to reduce overall search costs.24 Its architecture utilizes a Pre-trained Language Model (PLM), such as `DistilBERT-base`, as its backbone encoder.24 SCV compresses token information from documents into fixed-length span embeddings using a sliding window approach and various pooling techniques, then applies a MaxSim operation for scoring relevance.24

### 3.3 Typical Model Sizes and Architectural Nuances in Retrieval

The models employed in retrieval and reranking components of RAG systems exhibit a range of sizes and architectural characteristics, each optimized for specific aspects of the information retrieval pipeline.

**Retrieval Models (Encoders):**

- Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) encoders are commonly based on BERT, with sizes ranging from BERT-base (110 million parameters) to BERT-large (340 million parameters).19
- ColBERT models, fine-tuned from BERT, are designed to produce 128-dimensional vectors per token, allowing for fine-grained matching.16 Larger ColBERT-style models like ColPali can have approximately 3 billion parameters.23
- The Google Gecko embedding model, utilized for generic information retrieval, is a 1-billion parameter model with 768 dimensions.18
- The Gemma-2B embedding model, configured as a symmetric dual encoder, has an embedding size of 2048.18

**Reranking Models (Cross-Encoders):**

- `monoBERT` typically uses 110 million parameters, reflecting its BERT-base foundation.24
- Larger rerankers like `MonoT5` have 3 billion parameters.32
- More recent LLM-based rerankers (e.g., `RankLLaMA`, `RankVicuna`, `RankGPT`) can be significantly larger, leveraging the extensive knowledge encoded in generative LLMs for superior ranking capabilities.24

**Architectural Nuances:**

- **Efficiency vs. Precision:** The choice between dual encoders (for initial retrieval) and cross-encoders (for reranking) illustrates a fundamental trade-off. Dual encoders are highly efficient for initial retrieval due to their ability to pre-compute document embeddings, making them scalable for large corpora. Cross-encoders, while more computationally intensive (as they require joint processing of query and document), offer superior precision for reranking due to their deeper interaction modeling and contextual understanding.22
- **Generative Integration:** Generative retrieval models like DOGR represent a novel integration of generative capabilities directly into the retrieval process, aiming for a more unified and potentially streamlined pipeline compared to traditional two-stage (retrieval + generation) RAG.29
- **Granularity of Matching:** Multi-vector models like ColBERT provide a more granular level of matching compared to single-vector dense models. This can be particularly beneficial for complex queries requiring fine-grained relevance assessment across document content.23

## 4. Benchmarking and Evaluation

Evaluating the performance of text embedding and retrieval models is crucial for understanding their capabilities and suitability for various RAG applications. Several standardized benchmarks have emerged to provide comprehensive comparisons.

### 4.1 Text Embedding Benchmarks

The **Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB)**, hosted on Hugging Face, is a comprehensive benchmark for assessing the performance of embedding models across a wide range of tasks.7 MTEB aims for diversity, simplicity, extensibility, and reproducibility in its evaluations.33 It includes 8 different types of tasks with up to 15 datasets for each, covering 58 total datasets, 10 of which support multiple languages (112 languages in total).33 MTEB tests models on both short (sentence-level) and long (paragraph-level) texts.33

Key MTEB tasks include:

- **Bitext Mining:** Finding matching sentences in two different languages (measured by F1 score).33
- **Classification:** Sorting texts into categories (measured by accuracy).33
- **Clustering:** Grouping similar texts together (measured by v-measure).33
- **Pair Classification:** Deciding if two texts are similar (measured by average precision).33
- **Reranking:** Ordering a list of texts based on query match (measured by MAP - Mean Average Precision).33
- **Retrieval:** Finding relevant documents for a given query (measured by nDCG@10).33
- **Semantic Textual Similarity (STS):** Measuring how similar two sentences are (measured by Spearman correlation).33
- **Summarization:** Scoring machine-generated summaries against human-written ones (measured by Spearman correlation).33

Models are evaluated by converting texts into vector embeddings and then using methods like cosine similarity or logistic regression to perform the task and calculate scores.33 While MTEB provides valuable information about model performance, a high ranking does not necessarily mean a model is the best fit for every specific use case.7 Factors such as task-specific performance, computational requirements, and domain relevance must be considered.12 Domain-specific models, while not always topping general leaderboards, can offer superior performance for specialized applications.12

### 4.2 Text Retrieval Benchmarks

**BEIR (Benchmarking IR)** is a critical benchmark for evaluating how well search systems perform across many tasks and types of information, particularly focusing on zero-shot and out-of-domain evaluation.34 Developed to address limitations of existing evaluation methods, BEIR provides a more realistic assessment of search technology.34 It is a heterogeneous evaluation framework that tests various IR system models across diverse scenarios, including fact-checking, question answering, and biomedical information retrieval.34 Originally consisting of 18 datasets (with 14 publicly available), BEIR evaluates the versatility and robustness of IR systems in real-world applications.34 Its focus on zero-shot evaluation has provided important insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different IR models, particularly highlighting challenges faced by dense retrieval models in out-of-domain searches.34 BEIR can evaluate various retrieval systems, including dense and sparse retrievers, hybrid models, and re-ranking systems.36

### 4.3 RAG-Specific Benchmarks

Beyond general embedding and retrieval benchmarks, specialized benchmarks have emerged to evaluate end-to-end RAG system performance, particularly concerning critical aspects like factuality, reasoning, and conversational capabilities.

- **FRAMES (Factuality, Retrieval, And reasoning MEasurement Set):** This unified framework assesses LLM performance in end-to-end RAG scenarios across three dimensions: factuality, retrieval accuracy, and reasoning.36 The dataset comprises over 800 test samples featuring challenging multi-hop questions that require integrating information from 2-15 Wikipedia articles. FRAMES questions also cover different reasoning types, including numerical, tabular, and temporal reasoning, multiple constraints, and post-processing.36
- **RAGTruth:** This benchmark is specifically designed to evaluate the extent of hallucination in RAG systems, tailored for analyzing word-level hallucinations.36 It comprises 18,000 naturally generated responses from diverse LLMs using RAG and distinguishes between four types of hallucinations: evident conflict, subtle conflict, evident introduction of baseless information, and subtle introduction of baseless information.36 RAGTruth can assess both hallucination frequencies in different models and the effectiveness of hallucination detection methodologies.
- **MTRAG (Multi-Turn RAG):** Developed by IBM Research, MTRAG is a new benchmark and dataset designed to evaluate LLMs for the ambiguity and unpredictability inherent in multi-turn, extended conversations.2 The dataset consists of 110 extended conversations across four enterprise-relevant domains (finance, general knowledge, IT documentation, and government knowledge). This benchmark addresses the observation that while LLMs are adept at one-off question-answering tasks with RAG, their performance tends to decline in complex, multi-turn conversational scenarios.2 MTRAG evaluates faithfulness to reference passages, similarity/relevance/completeness to reference answers, and algorithmic metrics.2

## 5. Emerging Trends and Future Directions

The field of Retrieval-Augmented Generation is rapidly evolving, driven by ongoing research and increasing demand for more accurate, context-aware, and efficient AI systems. Several key trends are shaping the future of text embedding and retrieval within RAG.

- **Real-Time RAG:** Future AI systems are expected to dynamically retrieve the most recent information by integrating real data feeds into RAG models.30 This capability will ensure that generative AI solutions deliver precise and contextually appropriate material by establishing connections with external knowledge bases, websites, and structured data sources. This is particularly critical for sectors requiring constant data updates, such as finance or news.30

## 6. Conclusions

The analysis of state-of-the-art text embedding and retrieval models reveals a dynamic and rapidly advancing field, fundamentally transforming the capabilities of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. The core function of these models is to convert text into semantically rich numerical representations and efficiently retrieve relevant information, thereby grounding LLM responses in external knowledge and significantly mitigating issues like factual inaccuracies.

A significant evolution in information retrieval is evident, moving from traditional lexical matching to sophisticated semantic understanding enabled by dense embeddings. This shift allows RAG systems to retrieve context that is truly relevant and nuanced, even when exact keywords are not present. Furthermore, while the increasing size of LLM context windows might suggest a diminished role for RAG, the evidence indicates that RAG continues to be a critical component. It functions as an intelligent curatorial layer, efficiently identifying and presenting the most salient information from vast and dynamic knowledge bases. This focused input allows LLMs to operate more effectively and accurately, particularly in complex scenarios involving millions of documents or contradictory information.

The landscape of embedding models showcases a diverse range of architectures, including encoder-only, decoder-only, dual encoders, and multi-vector models like ColBERT. Innovations such as Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) exemplify a move towards adaptive deployment, allowing models to adjust their output dimensionality to balance quality with storage and computational costs. This flexibility is crucial for practical implementation across varying resource environments. The "state-of-the-art" in embedding models is not a singular, universally superior model; rather, it is context-dependent, with the optimal choice influenced by specific application requirements, budget, latency constraints, and domain specificity. Smaller, highly optimized models are increasingly competitive, broadening the accessibility of advanced RAG capabilities.

Retrieval models have also seen substantial advancements, with dense retrieval methods like DPR and ColBERT offering superior semantic understanding compared to sparse methods like BM25. The emergence of generative retrieval paradigms, which integrate the indexing function directly into the model, represents a novel approach to streamlining the retrieval pipeline. However, the most robust RAG systems often leverage hybrid retrieval approaches, combining the strengths of both sparse and dense methods to achieve comprehensive and accurate results across diverse query types. Reranking models, particularly cross-encoders, further enhance precision by performing a deeper, joint analysis of queries and retrieved documents.

Looking ahead, the field is poised for further innovations, including real-time data integration, advanced hybrid retrieval techniques, multimodal content processing, and personalized RAG implementations. These developments underscore the ongoing commitment to making AI systems more accurate, efficient, and adaptable to complex real-world challenges. For practitioners, a thorough understanding of these models' architectures, sizes, and performance characteristics, coupled with rigorous, context-specific evaluation, remains paramount for building effective and scalable RAG solutions.
