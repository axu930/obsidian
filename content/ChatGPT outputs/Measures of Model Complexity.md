### üìê **1. Rademacher Complexity**

- **Purpose**: Measures how well a function class can fit random noise.
    
- **Definition**: Given a sample, it computes the expected supremum of correlation between random ¬±1 labels and functions in the class.
    
- **Use**: Tighter generalization bounds than VC dimension in many cases.
    
- **Scale**: Depends on sample size and function class; lower is better for generalization.

### üßÆ **2. Covering Numbers / Metric Entropy**

- **Purpose**: Captures how many small balls are needed to cover the hypothesis space.
    
- **Definition**: The logarithm of the covering number (with respect to some metric, often L2) is the metric entropy.
    
- **Use**: Appears in bounds like Dudley's entropy integral; closely related to fat-shattering.
    
- **Interpretation**: Larger covering numbers ‚Üí more complex function class.

### üìä **3. Gaussian Complexity / Gaussian Width**

- **Purpose**: Similar to Rademacher complexity, but using Gaussian noise instead.
    
- **Use**: Arises in bounds for kernel methods, compressed sensing, and empirical process theory.
    
- **Mathematics**: Expected supremum of a Gaussian process over the function class.
